I always wanted a corner of my own on this wild zoo that we call internet, and finally made one. I'm Sambhav and I try to write as much as I can to slow down my brain. It's mostly my thoughts and notes which I occassionally write after having some trash thought.

Presently, I work as a Software Engineer at [cred.club](https://cred.club) and have discovered my love for complex engineering and writing. I am a big fan of OSS and try to contribute as much as I can to some mind-blowing projects made and maintanined by truly amazing folks.

My curiosity generally takes me to some unseen and uninviting places. Currently, it's all about applied cryptography and privacy.

I'll try to mold this website into something of my own.
