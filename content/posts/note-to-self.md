These are the list of quotes that I have discovered the meaning while doing some bullshit. Or loved it in first reading and trying to find the meaning of it through my experience. Attaching my stories or comments in the footnotes.

- You only **count** after it starts hurting.[^1]
- **Action** is the best self-help book.[^2]
- **Writing** is the best meditation.[^3]
- **Possible** than Practical.[^4]
- Play the **fool**.[^5]
- "Nothing is more important than seeing the **sources of invention** which are, in my opinion, more interesting than the inventions themselves." – Leibniz (1646-1716) [^6]
- This is **water**.[^7]
- **Believe** in others.[^8]
- Don’t care about the **destination**, enjoy the **journey**.[^9]
- Unhealthy **obsession**.[^10]
- **Generalise** and **Unlearn**.[^11]
- **Uncertainty** is better than **discomfort**.[^12]
- Entrepreneur's mind. Athlete's body. Artist's soul. [^13]
- "Suffering becomes beautiful when anyone bears great calamity with cheerfulness, not through insensibility but through greatness of mind." - Aristotle [^14]

## Undiscovered but Intriguing

- Focus is all about cutting distractions.[^15]
- The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.[^16]
- You are going to be dead soon. No need to be shameful. You are already naked.[^17]
- "Your worst sin is that you betrayed yourself for nothing." - Dostoevsky [^18]
- "Don't be a career." - Steve Jobs
- "I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success… such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything." - Nikola Tesla

[^1]: I used to think doing 15 reps was okay and will lead me to gains, but discovered that 12 of those 15 reps is just time waste. You do them for those last 3 reps. That's when it matters.
[^2]: God knows I've read so many self help books, articles about motivation which led me nowhere. Training my body has led me to believe that only action matters when you're confused. [Thinking](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vzfz4AS6wbooaTeQk/staring-into-the-abyss-as-a-core-life-skill) is for a peaceful and calm mind.
[^3]: I just love writing my thoughts out into a plain paper, scribbling, drawing
[^4]: Claude Shannon's [Creative Thinking](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~naderi/Claude%20Shannon.html) is one of the most practical pieces I've read on Creativeness. Any other book, article, podcast never give you the path that they followed. This article has it.
[^5]: Ethan Hawke: [Give yourself permission to be creative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRS9Gek4V5Q)
[^6]:Have been like this from the start, but lost this somehow in this world. Always been interested about the why's and how did something get created rather than creation itself.
[^7]: Loved the David Foster Wallace's [commencement speech](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/) so much, watched it 5 times when I first watched it.
[^8]: We are so much more capable of what we think of ourselves. Underestimating myself was like second nature for me. Never would have done anything if not for the people who believed in me.
[^9]: You only realise the value of something you love when you let it go. When you love a thing so much, why would you ever want to leave it, right? LOVE YOUR OBSESSIONS.
[^10]: Observed in me that things that I'm trying to learn stick with me for longer time when I am randomly trying to look through the details. Deadlines suck. Period.
[^11]: Read somewhere the similarities between generalizing and unlearning. Our brain unlearns by generalising, increasing it’s long term memory capacity each time.
[^12]: More like, uncertainty houses discomfort. You can feel comfortable and uncomfortable doing uncertain things, but you won’t feel certain and uncertain when doing uncomfortable things.
[^13]: Atomic Habits - James Clear
[^14]: This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0UTeQfnzfM) of Mathematician Prof. Andrew Wiles is perfect example of the quote `Beauty is Suffering`.
[^15]: "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things." - Steve Jobs
[^16]: [Richard Feynman's 1974 Caltech commencement speech](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm)
[^17]: "Let each thing you do, say, or intend be like that of a dying person" - Marcus Aurelius
[^18]: Meditations
