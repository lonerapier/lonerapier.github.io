Holomorhpic function (also known as Analytic function) usually refer to functions that are inifinitely differentiable.

Formal Definition:

Let G be an open set in $\mathbb{C}$. A function $f: G \to C$ is called holomorphic if, at every point $z \in G$, the complex derivative

$$f'(z) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z+h) - f(z)}{h}$$

exists as a complex number where $\mathbb{C}$  = complex realm.

## Meromorphic Functions

Meromorphic Function is the ratio of two analytic function which are analytic except for [[zeroes-and-poles|isolated singularities]].
