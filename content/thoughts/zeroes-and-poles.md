In complex analysis, functions are studied that are differentiable (in the complex space) at almost all points. Zeroes and poles are very important concept.

**Zeros** are termed as points at which a function $f, f(z) = 0$.

A **Pole** (also called an *isolated singularity*) is a point where the limit of a complex function inflates dramatically with polynomial growth.

More specifically, a point $z_0$ is a pole of a complex valued function f if the function value $f(z)$ tends to infinity as $z$ gets closer to $z_0$. If the limit is finite, then $z_0$ is not a pole.

$z_0$ is a pole of order $n$ if:

$$\lim\limits_{z \to z_0} (z-z_0) \cdot f(z) \neq 0$$

What is done here is $f(z)$ is multiplied by $(z-z_0)^n$ and then taking limit as $z$ approaches $z_0$. If the result is not equal to $0$, then $z_0$ is a pole.
